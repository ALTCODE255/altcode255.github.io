                    <b class="text-primary">Short answer:</b>
                    The "ASS Counter" is a utility / program / automated-system-of-various-different-programs I use to keep track of how many times I type or say "Akechi", "Sonic", or "Shuuen" in a given day.
                </p>
                <b class="text-primary">Long answer:</b>
                <details id="long-answer">
                    <summary class="my-1">(A long tangent about its history. Click to expand.)</summary>
                    <div class="card card-body">
                        <p>
                            In summary, the counter is my firstborn child. My beloved. The silly little tally counter/table/sheet that has been with me through hell and back (since <b>August 22nd, 2020</b>). It started as a way for me to keep track of how many times I mentioned <b>Shuuen</b> on any given day, but then later evolved to capture major current interests / passions that would become a regular part of my vocabulary. Prior to October 14th, 2024, it was named the "S Counter", due to words prior to "Akechi" on the counter beginning with the letter S.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (At some point, <b>Stanley</b> was a word on the counter (<b>June 2022 -> August 2022</b>) in reference to the Stanley Parable, before getting removed due to a loss in interest.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most recent notable addition to the counter was on <b>October 14th, 2024</b>, when <b>Akechi</b> was added to the counter in reference to Goro Akechi from Persona 5.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strike>The most recent notable addition to the counter was in <b>July of 2022</b>, when <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog became a major interest. This word has flourished in the bot ever since, to the point of being said more than <em>twice</em> the total number of times as Shuuen.</strike>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ASS Counter has been through many developments. Originally, the data was kept on a plain Google spreadsheet (archived <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VyD1fDG6noKldoNCQIhoGNAX7cTwuP8HAI0PViik0k0/">here</a>), with statistics calculated using a crap ton of formulas. It was just that for the longest time, actually.
                        </p>
                        Until:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                On <a href="https://twitter.com/ALTCODE255/status/1483347946305466368">January 17th, 2022</a>, I made a Twitter bot out of it using a combination of Zapier (later moving to Microsoft Power Automate) and more complicated Google Sheets formulas. Note: Separate from this, I learned Python, my first (proper) programming language, in the same month.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In <b>January of 2023</b>, I added tally boxes that had scripted functionality (using Google Apps Script) to increment the value of a cell by one, so I didn't have to manually type numbers myself anymore. I also had it automatically add new rows every day.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <a href="https://twitter.com/ALTCODE255/status/1646057020699869184">April 12th, 2023</a>, I wrote a Python script to run in the background of my computer that would automatically increment the counter when I typed Shuuen/Sonic or pressed certain hotkeys.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Around the same time, I wrote a similar script I could manually activate on Home Assistant from my phone to perform the same task, minus the keyboard tracking.</li>
                                    <li>Also around the same time, I integrated the ASS Counter with my personal Discord bot, so that I could increment it using commands.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <a href="https://twitter.com/ALTCODE255/status/1648968037889110016">April 20th, 2023</a>, when the Twitter API's free functionality got limited and MS Power Automate stopped providing a shared application for the Twitter API, I finally migrated the bot to a Python script (scheduled to run with cron on my Raspberry Pi) using Tweepy, while still pulling data from Google Sheets using Pygsheets.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <a href="https://twitter.com/ALTCODE255/status/1654260297912451075">May 4th, 2023</a>, this page was created.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <a href="https://twitter.com/ALTCODE255/status/1715208772078141770">October 19th, 2023</a>, I finally stopped using Google Sheets to store the tally counter's data, and moved the table to an SQLite3 database. I still needed a way to keep this page live, so I wrote a simple bash script to export the database to a markdown file and upload said file to Github as a gist every hour, which would then be embedded onto this webpage.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <a href="https://twitter.com/ALTCODE255/status/1723615819874390225">November 11th, 2023</a>, I ditched Github's gist embed to write a cleaner one, using Showdown.js to convert the contents of the markdown file to an HTML table.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        And then I also wrote an absurdly long tangent gushing about a project featuring a table with useless numbers. Which is what you see here.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <b>February 5th, 2024</b>, I ditched using Python's keyboard module for hotkeys and hotstrings and replaced my startup Python script with an AHK script. AHK is definitely more suitable for this job.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <b>December 10th, 2024</b>, I migrated the database from SQLite3 to a PostgreSQL instance hosted in Supabase.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <b>December 20th, 2024</b>, I added a cool plot to represent the data, using Plotly.js.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <b>January 21st, 2025</b>, I added a way to customize the number of days displayed by the table/graph.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <b>January 22nd, 2025</b>, I added a table to show total stats per word.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On <b>February 8th, 2025</b>, I added calculations for 30-day averages.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </details>
                <h2>Why is it named like this?</h2>
                <p>
                    Simple. ASS as an abbreviation for "Akechi, Sonic, Shuuen" is really funny. It used to be called the S Counter, and I needed to rename it after Akechi broke the pattern.
